    <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>There are few sights in the world as iconic as the Taj Mahal, which is a must-see on most India itineraries, particularly for travelers on the famous Golden Triangle circuit, linking Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. A testament to the power of an emperor’s love, 
      this astonishingly beautiful mausoleum was named after Mumtaz Mahal, who was the favorite wife of Shah Jahan.</p>

    <h2>Red Fort</h2>
    <p>New Delhi's colossal, crescent-shaped Red Fort, named after the stunning red sandstone that was used in its construction, was built by Shah Jahan in 1648. Also called Lal Qalʿah, it was home to emperors of the formidable Mughal dynasty for almost 200 years, until 1857 when the British took over. It covers a vast area of 254.67 acres ringed by one and a half miles of defensive walls, enclosing a complex of palaces and entertainment halls, 
      projecting balconies, baths and indoor canals, and geometrical gardens, as well as an ornate mosque.</p>
